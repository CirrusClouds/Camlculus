The Untyped Lambda Calculus Interpreter (+ Parser Combinator Library) Written in Ocaml  

Combinator contains generic parsers that can be re-used and re-applied to any interpreter you want to make. Feel free to steal it! I think it came out very well.
Parser contains the specific parsers for the Lambda Calculus interpreter that I'm writing, as well as type definitions for different primitives and combinations.
Interpreter contains the meat of the evaluator, inspired primarily by Lambda Calculus but also made referencing the SICP Lecture 7A on metacircular evaluators.

Useage details can be found in interpreter.ml

This project is unfinished. I want to eventually add dependent types.
